# hadoop_mapr wrapper cookbook

# Description

This cookbook is a wrapper cookbook for the [Hadoop_mapr cookbook](https://github.com/caskdata/hadoop_mapr_cookbook).  It is a part of [Coopr](https://github.com/caskdata/coopr), which is a general purpose tool that can spin up several types of clusters including MapR Hadoop.  This cookbook provides several initialization recipes for MapR/Hadoop components.  It does not actually start any of the MapR services.  This can be done by wrapping the service resources in the underlying [Hadoop_mapr cookbook](https://github.com/caskdata/hadoop_mapr_cookbook), for example:
```ruby
    ruby_block "start warden" do
      block do
        resources("mapr-warden").run_action(:start)
      end 
    end
```

Additional information on how to wrap cookbooks in general can be found in the [Hadoop cookbook wiki](https://github.com/caskdata/hadoop_cookbook/wiki/Wrapping-this-cookbook).

# Requirements

This cookbook may work on earlier versions, but these are the minimal tested versions:

* Chef 11.16.4+
* CentOS 6.6+
* Ubuntu 12.04+


# Cookbook Dependencies

* hadoop_mapr
* mysql
* database

# Attributes

There are no attributes specific to this cookbook, however we set many default attributes for the underlying cookbooks in order to have a reasonably configured MapR cluster.  Be sure to look at the attributes files and override as desired.

Note: in order to initialize the Hive Metastore database, root credentials must be
supplied.  Currently, this must be set in `node['mysql']['server_root_password']`

# Usage

Include the relevant [recipes](#recipes) in your run-list.
